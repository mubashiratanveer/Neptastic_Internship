            <p>
                Father of 3 humans, 5 unicorns & 2 dogs, I design since I can remember it. I often get asked where I get
                my inspiration from: in everyday’s lil’ details. And sometimes in leftover food I find in my bear.

            When I was 5, I got adbucted by a unicorn family. When they returned me to earth, I joined a designer
            school. But, fo’ real, what I learned with my kidnaptive family really gave an edge to my creative language.

            Try it and you’ll see. Then your Figma files are just gonna fly in color, glitter, interactions and
            autolayout.
            <span class="highlight">Also, grow a beard. Check my bio if that is not clear.</span>
